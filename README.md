#  ASL Gesture Recognition AI ✋🔤

> **Empowering Communication Through AI | Helping the Deaf and Mute Community**

---

## 🧠 Overview

**HOPE** is an AI-based system designed to recognize hand gestures from the **American Sign Language (ASL)** and convert them into **text or speech** in real-time. Using machine learning and computer vision, it bridges the communication gap between the deaf/mute community and the hearing world.

## 🌟 Key Features

- ✋ **ASL Hand Gesture Detection**
- 🧠 **Deep Learning-Based Recognition (LSTM/MediaPipe)**
- 🗣️ **Text and Voice Output**
- 💡 **Real-Time Prediction Interface**
- 🖥️ **Web-based UI using Flask**

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User shows a hand sign** in front of the webcam.
2. **MediaPipe** detects and extracts hand landmarks.
3. **Trained AI model (LSTM)** classifies the gesture.
4. **Output is displayed** on-screen as text and/or converted to speech.
