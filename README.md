#  ASL Gesture Recognition AI ‚úãüî§

> **Empowering Communication Through AI | Helping the Deaf and Mute Community**

---

## üß† Overview

**HOPE** is an AI-based system designed to recognize hand gestures from the **American Sign Language (ASL)** and convert them into **text or speech** in real-time. Using machine learning and computer vision, it bridges the communication gap between the deaf/mute community and the hearing world.

## üåü Key Features

- ‚úã **ASL Hand Gesture Detection**
- üß† **Deep Learning-Based Recognition (LSTM/MediaPipe)**
- üó£Ô∏è **Text and Voice Output**
- üí° **Real-Time Prediction Interface**
- üñ•Ô∏è **Web-based UI using Flask**

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **User shows a hand sign** in front of the webcam.
2. **MediaPipe** detects and extracts hand landmarks.
3. **Trained AI model (LSTM)** classifies the gesture.
4. **Output is displayed** on-screen as text and/or converted to speech.
